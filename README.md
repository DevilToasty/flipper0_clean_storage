A clean storage application for Flipper Zero. It calculates used, free, and total storage and displays it in a clean percentage bar.
You are able to switch the display of text and choose between GB free / GB total or % free and % used.

This is my first Flipper 0 application and C project, so any suggestions to improve the code are appreciated. 
If you have any questions, reach out to me at bradleybreen05@gmail.com.
